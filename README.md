# web-styling
This repository contains styling for some external web pages. I create and test these styles with [User CSS for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb) and the excellent [Cascadea for Safari](https://cascadea.app).

[JIRA styling](jira/README.md)

These stylings are freely supplied, please use them and adapt them as you please.
